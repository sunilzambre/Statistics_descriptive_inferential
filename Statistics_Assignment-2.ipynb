    "***1) What is statistics? <br>***\n",
    "Ans-Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is used to describe and analyze data, make predictions, and inform decision-making in various fields such as business, economics, medicine, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics can be divided into two main categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves the use of numerical and graphical techniques to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. These techniques include measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, and measures of variability, such as variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves using statistical methods to make inferences about a population based on a sample. These methods involve hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, among others. Inferential statistics is used to make predictions about future observations, to determine the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention, and to identify relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is an important tool in many fields, as it provides a way to make informed decisions based on data and evidence. It is used in business to analyze market trends, in medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, and in social sciences to understand human behavior."

    "2) Ordinal data ----> Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. \n",
    "- The significant feature of the nominal data is that the difference between the data values is not determined. \n",

    "1) Nominal scales contain the least amount of information. In nominal scales, the numbers assigned to each variable or observation are only used to classify the variable or observation. For example, a fund manager may choose to assign the number 1 to small-cap stocks, the number 2 to corporate bonds, the number 3 to derivatives, and so on. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ordinal scales present more information than nominal scales and are, therefore, a higher level of measurement. In ordinal scales, there is an ordered relationship between the variable’s observations. For example, a list of 500 managers of mutual funds may be ranked by assigning the number 1 to the best-performing manager, the number 2 to the second best-performing manager, and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Interval scales are ordinal scales but with equivalent scale values from low to high intervals. For example, temperature measurement is an example of an interval scale: 60°C is colder than 65°C, and the temperature difference is the same as the difference between 50°C and 55°C. <br>\n",
